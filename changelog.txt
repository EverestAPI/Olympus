#changelog#
∙ Windows: Stop force-downgrading lua51.dll to make Olympus *somehow* work for some people
  (the downgraded DLL will be separately in the package instead if it is needed)
∙ Linux Flatpak: (Hopefully) fix executing Celeste or Everest when their paths has spaces in them
∙ macOS: Resized app icon to match other Mac apps
